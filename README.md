## User Guide
Rock Paper Scissors is a straight forward game and so is this project, once your game is running you will be presented with a rundown of the games flow. It will explain all options to the user and what they mean.
Immediately the game will begin and you will be asked for your input, the folowing options are:
- 1 - Rock
- 2 - Paper
- 3 - Scissors
- q - Quit

The user can exit the game at anytime by inputting q into the console, any input provided that does not match to one of the four valid inputs [1, 2, 3 or q] will result in an error message and prompt for input again.
Once the user chooses an option for 1, 2 or 3, the game then generates a random answer for the CPU, the game then decides the winner based on what the CPU chose and what the player chose.
